ue -> l2 : [628.7] RRC SETUP Complete (RLC HEAD: a0 00, sn = 0, p = 1, request RLC status report)
l2 -> ue : [629.3] RLC ACK (00 04, ack_sn = 1)
ue -> l2 : [629.7] HARQ Value 4
note over l2, ue 
MAC parses HARQ value 4 as NACK and retransmits RLC ACK,
but actually UE should have received the RLC ACK and not 
retransmit RRC SETUP complete
end note

... retransmit RLC ACK ...

l2 -> ue : [629.8] Identity Request (RLC segment 1, RLC HEAD: 88 00, sn = 0, p = 0, not request RLC status report)

ue -> l2 : [630.7] RLC ACK (00 08, ack_sn = 2)
note over l2, ue 
MAC parses HARQ value 4 as NACK and retransmits identity request
segment 1 and segment 2, but actually UE should have received
both segments and responsed RLC ACK 
end note

... retransmit Identity Request ...

note over l2, ue 
MAC schedules UL resource in every UL subframe for the UE,
but UE still sends SR to request UL resource instead of 
sending UL data directly with allocated resource by DCI0 before
end note

... send DCI0 to allocate UL resource in SF 2 and 7 ...
ue -> l2 : [707.7] SR (700 ms after receiving identity request)
l2 -> ue : [708.3] DCI0 (8 RB)
l2 -> phy : [708.7]  UL SCH cfg 
ue -> l2 : [708.7] Unknown UL SCH data (CRC error)
