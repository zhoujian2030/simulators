ue -> l2 : [664.7] RRC SETUP Complete (RLC HEAD: a0 00, sn = 0, p = 1, request RLC status report)
l2 -> ue : [665.3] RLC ACK (00 04, ack_sn = 1)
ue -> l2 : [665.7] HARQ Value 4
note over l2, ue 
MAC parses HARQ value 4 as NACK and retransmits RLC ACK,
but actually UE should have received the RLC ACK and not 
retransmit RRC SETUP complete
end note

... retransmit RLC ACK ...

... send DCI0 to allocate UL resource in every SF 2 and 7 ...

note over l2, ue 
MAC schedules identity request after some delay (100 ~ 300ms)
end note

l2 -> ue : [699.0] Identity Request (RLC segment 1, RLC HEAD: 88 00, sn = 0, p = 0, not request RLC status report)
l2 -> ue : [699.1] Identity Request (RLC segment 2, RLC HEAD: b0 01, sn = 1, p = 1, request RLC status report)
ue -> l2 : [699.7] HARQ value 1 (for RLC segment 1 & 2)

note over l2, ue 
UE sends SR to request UL resource to send identity response 
end note
