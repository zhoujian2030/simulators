MAC parses HARQ value 4 as NACK and retransmits identity request
segment 1 and segment 2, but actually UE should have received
both segments and responsed RLC ACK

note over l2, ue 
MAC schedules UL resource in every UL subframe for the UE,
UE sends identity response in some UL subframe later
end note
