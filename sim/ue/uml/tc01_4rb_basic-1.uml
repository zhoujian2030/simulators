title MAC allocate 4 RB for SR, normal basic flow, 1st part

participant "UE" as ue
participant "PHY Adapterer" as phy
participant "L2" as l2
participant "L3" as l3

note over ue, l2
UE sends MSG1
end note

ue -> l2 : [**698.1**] RACH, RA-RNTI, preamble

note over ue, l2
Network sends MSG2 with 2 TTI advance to PHY
end note

l2 -> phy : [**698.3**] FAPI_DL_DCI_FORMAT_1A & FAPI_DLSCH_PDU, RA-RNTI
l2 -> ue : [**698.5**] RAR, TC-RNTI

note over ue, l2
UE sends MSG3 in the 2nd UL SF after RAR received
end note
l2 -> phy : [**699.1**] FAPI_ULSCH (1 TTI advance)
ue -> l2 : [**699.2**] MSG3 (RRC Connection Request), TC-RNTI
phy -> l2 : [**699.2**] MSG3 CRC (0: Correct)

note over ue, l2
Network sends MSG4
end note
l2 -> phy : [**699.6**] FAPI_DL_DCI_FORMAT_1A & FAPI_DLSCH_PDU, TC-RNTI
l2 -> ue : [**699.8**] Contention Resolution, TC-RNTI
l2 --> phy : [**700.1**] FAPI_UCI_HARQ (Cfg PHY to recv HARQ)
ue -> l2 : [**700.2**] HARQ ACK

note over ue, l3
Network sends RRC Setup.
Which SFN/SF to send RRC setup in MAC depends on the time receiving RRC setup from L3
end note

l2 -> l3 : RRC Connection Request 
... 

l3 -> l2 : Create UE context (PDCP/RLC/MAC/PHY)
l2 -> phy : PHY_UE_CONFIG_REQUEST (cfgMode = 1)
phy -> l2 : PHY_UE_CONFIG_RESPONSE
l2 -> l3 : Response
l3 -> l2 : RRC Connection Setup

l2 -> phy : [**704.1**] FAPI_DL_DCI_FORMAT_1A & FAPI_DLSCH_PDU, C-RNTI = TC-RNTI
l2 -> ue : [**704.3**] RRC Connection Setup, C-RNTI
l2 --> phy : [**704.6**] FAPI_UCI_HARQ
ue -> l2 : [**704.7**] HARQ ACK (for RRC Connection Setup)

note over ue, l3
UE sends SR to request UL resurce for RRC Setup complete.
which UL SFN and SF depends on srConfigIndex. 
If srConfigIndex = 17, the SR periodicity is 20ms, send SR in UL SF 2
If srConfigIndex = 72, the SR periodicity is 40ms, send SR in UL SF 7
end note

l2 --> phy : [**706.1**] FAPI_UCI_SR (Cfg PHY to recv SR)
ue -> l2 : [**706.2**] SR
l2 -> ue : [**706.8**] FAPI_UL_DCI_FORMAT_0 (4 RB)
l2 -> phy : [**707.1**] FAPI_ULSCH
ue -> l2 : [**707.2**] RRC Setup Complete
phy -> l2 : [**707.2**] RRC Setup Complete CRC (0: Correct)
l2 -> l3 : RRC Setup Complete
l2 -> phy : [**707.4**] FAPI_DL_DCI_FORMAT_1A & FAPI_DLSCH_PDU
l2 -> ue : [**707.6**] RLC ACK for RRC Setup Complete
l2 -> ue : [**707.8**] FAPI_HI_PDU (HARQ ACK for RRC Setup Complete)
l2 --> phy : [**708.1**] FAPI_UCI_HARQ
ue --> l2 : [**708.2**] HARQ ACK for RLC ACK received in 707.6
